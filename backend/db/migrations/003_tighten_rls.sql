-- Migration 003: Tighten Row-Level Security on shared org tables
-- Run in Supabase SQL editor after 002_llm_usage.sql
--
-- Closes #10.
--
-- The original `001_initial_schema.sql` declared three policies as
-- `for select using (true)` so any authenticated user could read every row:
--   - design_systems
--   - brand_voice
--   - assets
--
-- Backend routes that touch these tables already check `require_permission`
-- with the service-role client (which bypasses RLS), so the privilege check
-- works there. The hole is the extension's anon-key Supabase client: a
-- `viewer`-role user (or any auth.users row without a `user_profiles` entry)
-- could `select *` directly and enumerate the org's brand assets, case
-- studies, competitor intel, etc.
--
-- Write operations (INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE) are already denied by default:
-- RLS is enabled on these tables but 001 never added write policies, so
-- Postgres falls through to deny for any non-service-key caller. This
-- migration does not change that behaviour: writes remain backend-only via
-- the service key.
--
-- This migration drops the `using (true)` SELECT policies and replaces them
-- with policies that require the caller to have a known role in user_profiles.
-- `viewer` is excluded: viewers are not supposed to see brand internals.
-- The role set matches `require_permission` checks in the corresponding
-- backend routes (`assets:read`, `brand_voice:read`, `design_system:read`).

-- ── Helper: role-gated read ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- Returns true if the calling user has a role with read access to org-wide
-- brand/asset data. Declared as SECURITY INVOKER so it runs in the caller's
-- RLS context, no privilege escalation. STABLE lets Postgres cache the result
-- within a single query (avoids one extra lookup per row).
--
-- Note: if auth.uid() has no user_profiles row (e.g. an orphaned auth.users
-- entry), the subquery returns no rows and exists() evaluates to false.
-- This is intentional: unprovisioned users get no access.
